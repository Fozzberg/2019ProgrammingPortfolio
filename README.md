## First Semester Processing Calculator
#### Completed Nov, 2018

The purpose of this application is a real functioning calculator. It has the 5 simple calculations as well as some more advanced ones such as square root, square function, percent function, sin, cosine, and tangent. A cool feature is the wood changing texture as you hover over it.
